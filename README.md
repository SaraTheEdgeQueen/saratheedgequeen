## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Sara. I like making things, some meant for browsersðŸ’», some that move around as robots ðŸ¤–, and sometimes stranger ones that show up in places even I wouldnâ€™t expect haha.

Most of the time, Iâ€™m writing software (usually with some good beats in the background).
Every now and then, I wander off on side quests â€” like wiring up Jira, Zapier, Zendesk, and OpenAI so they quietly take care of repetitive work, or slipping some AI into CPQ tools to make them quicker and friendlierâ€¦ like using vector embeddings for retrieval augmented generation(RAG).

Outside of work, I follow whatever sparks my curiosity...
Thatâ€™s taken me to [XAI Face Clustering](https://github.com/karbolak/xai-face-clustering), where I explored whether facial recognition could explain itself.
To [Mars Rovers](https://github.com/orgs/makercie-rug/teams/maintenance-onsite_2024), where I got to expand my interstellar dreams and keep machines happy out in the real world.
To little helpers like [Jira Transition Issue](https://github.com/Elfsquad/jira-transition-issue), which quietly moves tickets along so people donâ€™t have to.
And for pure fun, I tucked in this DogeCoin inspired story, [ShibeRevolution](https://github.com/SaraTheEdgeQueen/ShibeRevolution), a meme-game for those doom-scroll moments, and its cutesy sequel, [2Kul4Skul](https://github.com/SaraTheEdgeQueen/2Kul4Skul), which shows Doge sent into space, to square off with the bongoCat Bo$$â€”cat-in-a-spinning-cup style. Perfect if you need a giggle (and feel like working with a Python compiler).


Funny thing is, I never set out to mix web development, AI, robotics, and meme-gamesâ€”but they all kind of get along in my hands now, and genuienly, as odd as it, I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything xD


If youâ€™re into creating odd, wonderful stuff, I hope youâ€™ll feel right at home here! And if youâ€™ve got something fun cooking or a wild idea to share or look together into, you can reach me at:
